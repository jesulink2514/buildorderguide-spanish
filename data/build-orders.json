You want close natural barriers so that you don't have to wall too much and you want safe resources so you can't be attacked easily from outside the walls by towers and feudal archers. This build works with any civ, but especially well with Vietnamese, Aztecs, Britons, Goths, Celts, Vikings, Mayans, and Ethiopians.",

Economic upgrades cost no wood, meaning not as many lumberjacks are needed when hitting Feudal. 2. The enemy position is revealed from the start, which allows pushing two deer with the scout before you send your scout to the enemy's base. 3. Archers have +20% HP, which makes them tankier. Note that the 2nd lumber camp needs to wait until 2 ranges and the blacksmith are up. With this build you get a constant archer production as with the default archer build - except 1:15 minutes earlier - and a similar Castle time.",
